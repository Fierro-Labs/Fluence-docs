We have released the Aqua compiler 0.3. 

Now Aqua compiler runs natively in the javascript environment and distributed as [@fluencelabs/aqua](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluencelabs/aqua) NPM package. 

The next milestone is to call Aqua functions from the Aqua itself: we're building Aqua REPL.
See the [changelog](../docs/aqua-book/changelog).
