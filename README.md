# Fluence Docs

Fluence Docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

## Local Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
